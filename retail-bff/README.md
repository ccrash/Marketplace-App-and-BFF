## Key behaviours

**Cart expiry** — carts expire after 2 minutes of inactivity. Any mutation (add / update / remove) resets the timer. A background job cleans up expired carts every 15 seconds, so a cart may remain accessible for up to 15 seconds past its theoretical expiry.

**Stock reservations** — stock is reserved the moment an item is added to a cart, not at checkout. This prevents overselling across concurrent carts. Reservations are released on item removal, cart abandonment, or expiry.

**Prices** — all monetary values are integers in **pence** (e.g. `27999` = £279.99).

**Discount types**

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `PERCENTAGE_OFF` | Percentage off a specific product |
| `FIXED_AMOUNT_OFF` | Fixed pence off a specific product |
| `BUY_X_GET_Y_FREE` | Buy X units, get Y free |
| `BASKET_THRESHOLD` | Flat discount when basket exceeds a spend threshold |
| `MULTI_BUY_FIXED` | Fixed price for N items from a category |

## Tests

```bash
yarn test          # watch mode
yarn test:cov      # with coverage report
yarn test:e2e      # end-to-end tests
```

Tests use Jest. Unit tests cover services and the discount engine; e2e tests cover the full HTTP layer via Supertest.
